          "observation": "\"Brother from Another Series\" is the sixteenth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> eighth season.  It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 23, 1997.  Sideshow Bob is released from prison into the care of his brother Cecil and claims to be a changed man.  However, Bart does not believe him and tries to find out what Bob is up to.  It was the first episode directed by Pete Michels and was written by Ken Keeler.  The episode guest stars Kelsey Grammer in his sixth appearance as Sideshow Bob and David Hyde Pierce as Cecil.  The title is not only a pun on the movie \"The Brother from Another Planet\" (used for a previous episode as well), but also a reference to the fact that guest stars Kelsey Grammer (Frasier Crane) and David Hyde Pierce (Niles Crane) also played bickering brothers on the NBC sitcom \"Frasier\".",
