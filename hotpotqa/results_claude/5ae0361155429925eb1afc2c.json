The aircraft was flown by French World War I aviation heroes, Charles Nungesser and François Coli.  The aircraft took off from Paris on 8 May 1927 and was last seen over Ireland.  Less than two weeks later, Charles Lindbergh successfully made the New York–Paris journey and claimed the prize, flying the \"Spirit of St. Louis\".",
