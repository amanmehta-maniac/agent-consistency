Let me think if there are any hedgehog characters he voiced. Actually, in the Sonic universe, Shadow the Hedgehog is another character, but I don't see that mentioned. The most direct answer based on the information is that he's associated with the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise through voicing Dr. Robotnik. However, I should verify if there's more specific information about hedgehog characters.\n\nLet me search for more specific information about Jim Cummings and hedgehog characters.\n\nAction: Search\nAction Input: {\"query\": \"Jim Cummings hedgehog voice\"}"

Looking back at the Jim Cummings information, he voiced \"Dr. Robotnik from Sonic the Hedgehog.\" While Dr. Robotnik himself is not a hedgehog, I need to think about this more carefully.  Actually, wait - in some Sonic media, there might be hedgehog characters that Jim Cummings voiced. But based on the information provided, it only mentions Dr. Robotnik. However, the question specifically asks about a hedgehog character. Let me reconsider: Could there be a different interpretation? In the Sonic franchise, Dr. Robotnik is also known as Dr. Eggman, and he's the main antagonist, but he's human, not a hedgehog.  However, the most logical answer based on the information given is that Jim Cummings' connection to the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is through voicing Dr. Robotnik.
