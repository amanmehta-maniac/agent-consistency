Wolf Alice is a 4-piece band with 4 members, each playing specific instruments (vocals/guitar, guitars/vocals, bass, and drums/vocals).  To calculate the instrument to person ratio: - Badly Drawn Boy: 1 person who plays multiple instruments. As a multi-instrumentalist, he plays many instruments, but the ratio would be multiple instruments to 1 person, giving a ratio greater than 1. - Wolf Alice: 4 people with at least 4 main instruments (guitar, guitar, bass, drums) plus vocals. That's approximately 4-5 instruments to 4 people, giving a ratio of about 1 to 1.25.  Since Badly Drawn Boy is one person playing multiple instruments, his instrument to person ratio is higher than Wolf Alice's approximate 1:1 ratio.",
