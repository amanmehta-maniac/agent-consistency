Now I have the information I need: - Cypress is a common name for trees in the family Cupressaceae, with Cupressus being one of the genera that has this common name - Ajuga is explicitly stated to be a genus  So technically, \"Cypress\" is not a genus itself - it's a common name. However, if the question is asking about Cupressus (the genus commonly called cypress), then yes, both would be genera. But strictly speaking, \"Cypress\" as written is a common name, not a genus name.  Let me provide an accurate answer.",
