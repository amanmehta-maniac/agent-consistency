          "observation": "The Lewinsky scandal was an American political sex scandal that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.  The sexual relationship took place between 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998.  Clinton ended a televised speech with the statement that he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky.  Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives.  He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial.  Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.  His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.",
