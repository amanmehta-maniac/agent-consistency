After signing a contract with record label Polydor Records in July 2009, Goulding began to work on her debut studio album, \"Lights\", which was ultimately released in February 2010.  The first single released from the album was \"Under the Sheets\", which Goulding wrote in collaboration with Starsmith.  Starsmith co-wrote four other songs and served as the album's primary producer.  Goulding also collaborated with Jonny Lattimer on the singles \"Starry Eyed\" and \"The Writer\", and shared writing credits with Fraser T Smith on \"Your Biggest Mistake\".  In November 2010, the singer re-released \"Lights\" as \"Bright Lights\", which included the standard version of the album and several new songs.  She collaborated with Richard Stannard and Ash Howes on \"Lights\" and recorded a cover version of Elton John's \"Your Song\".  At this time, Goulding also contributed guest vocals on the song \"Wonderman\" for Tinie Tempah's debut studio album \"Disc-Overy\" (2010).",

          "observation": "\"On My Mind\" is a song by English singer Ellie Goulding from her third studio album \"Delirium\" (2015).  It was released as the album's lead single on 17 September 2015.  It was written by Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ilya Salmanzadeh.  \"On My Mind\" is an electropop and R&B song whose instrumentation consists of scratchy guitars, trap drums, slapped beats and sharp, syncopated electronica.  Lyrically, \"On My Mind\" talks about a one-night stand with someone the protagonist shouldn't be with, having a dichotomy between heart and head.  Though firmly denied by Goulding, many critics considered it an answer song to Ed Sheeran's \"Don't\".",

The first single released from the album was \"Under the Sheets\", which Goulding wrote in collaboration with Starsmith.  Starsmith co-wrote four other songs and served as the album's primary producer.  Goulding also collaborated with Jonny Lattimer on the singles \"Starry Eyed\" and \"The Writer\", and shared writing credits with Fraser T Smith on \"Your Biggest Mistake\".  In November 2010, the singer re-released \"Lights\" as \"Bright Lights\", which included the standard version of the album and several new songs.  She collaborated with Richard Stannard and Ash Howes on \"Lights\" and recorded a cover version of Elton John's \"Your Song\".

The first single released from the album was \"Under the Sheets\", which Goulding wrote in collaboration with Starsmith.  Starsmith co-wrote four other songs and served as the album's primary producer.  Goulding also collaborated with Jonny Lattimer on the singles \"Starry Eyed\" and \"The Writer\", and shared writing credits with Fraser T Smith on \"Your Biggest Mistake\".  In November 2010, the singer re-released \"Lights\" as \"Bright Lights\", which included the standard version of the album and several new songs.  She collaborated with Richard Stannard and Ash Howes on \"Lights\" and recorded a cover version of Elton John's \"Your Song\".
