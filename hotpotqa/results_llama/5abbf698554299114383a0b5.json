From its formation in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, it has flown a variety of aircraft types including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C).  During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C \"Wedgetail\".  One of the six Boeing 737s was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS.",

During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C \"Wedgetail\".

The squadron was formed in 1939 and saw combat in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II.  From 1941 to 1943, it mainly conducted maritime patrols off northern Australia.  The squadron was based at Merauke in western New Guinea from November 1943 to July 1944, when it was withdrawn from operations.  After being re-equipped, it operated as a heavy bomber unit from February 1945 until the end of the war.  The squadron continued in this role until it was redesignated No. 1 Squadron RAAF in February 1948.  The squadron was reformed in 1973 to operate transport helicopters but was again disbanded in 1989.",

Amongst the performance requirements for the type was the demand for an outstanding high altitude bombing capability in addition to flying at high speeds.  These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet propulsion technology.  When the Canberra was introduced to service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), the type's first operator, in May 1951, it became the service's first jet-powered bomber aircraft.",

During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C \"Wedgetail\".

The squadron was formed in 1939 and saw combat in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II.  From 1941 to 1943, it mainly conducted maritime patrols off northern Australia.  The squadron was based at Merauke in western New Guinea from November 1943 to July 1944, when it was withdrawn from operations.  After being re-equipped, it operated as a heavy bomber unit from February 1945 until the end of the war.  The squadron continued in this role until it was redesignated No. 1 Squadron RAAF in February 1948.

Originally designed as a fast passenger aircraft, between 1937 and 1939 this low-wing monoplane set 26 world records, qualifying it for some time as the fastest medium bomber in the world.  It first saw action during the Spanish Civil War and flew on all fronts in which Italy was involved during World War II.  It achieved success as a torpedo bomber in the Mediterranean theater, and became the best-known Italian aeroplane of the war.  It was easily recognizable due to its distinctive fuselage dorsal \"hump\", and was well liked by its crews, who nicknamed it \"il gobbo maledetto\" (\"damned hunchback\").",
