The first EP and several singles were released on Gough's own label \"Twisted Nerve\", which he started with like-minded Manchester musician Andy Votel.  Badly Drawn Boy rose in popularity in 1997 when he joined the likes of Thom Yorke, Richard Ashcroft, and Mike D on the celebrity-filled UNKLE album \"Psyence Fiction\".  Due to the mild UK chart success of the 1999 single \"Once Around the Block\", XL Recordings signed up Badly Drawn Boy to release the debut album \"The Hour of Bewilderbeast\" in 2000.  The album won critical praise and Britain's acclaimed Mercury Prize for Best Album.  The album caught the attention of author Nick Hornby who then asked Gough to score the film being made for his book \"About a Boy\".",

Badly Drawn Boy rose in popularity in 1997 when he joined the likes of Thom Yorke, Richard Ashcroft, and Mike D on the celebrity-filled UNKLE album \"Psyence Fiction\".  Due to the mild UK chart success of the 1999 single \"Once Around the Block\", XL Recordings signed up Badly Drawn Boy to release the debut album \"The Hour of Bewilderbeast\" in 2000.  The album won critical praise and Britain's acclaimed Mercury Prize for Best Album.

Badly Drawn Boy rose in popularity in 1997 when he joined the likes of Thom Yorke, Richard Ashcroft, and Mike D on the celebrity-filled UNKLE album \"Psyence Fiction\".  Due to the mild UK chart success of the 1999 single \"Once Around the Block\", XL Recordings signed up Badly Drawn Boy to release the debut album \"The Hour of Bewilderbeast\" in 2000.  The album won critical praise and Britain's acclaimed Mercury Prize for Best Album.
