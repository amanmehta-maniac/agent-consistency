It was written by Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ilya Salmanzadeh.  \"On My Mind\" is an electropop and R&B song whose instrumentation consists of scratchy guitars, trap drums, slapped beats and sharp, syncopated electronica.  Lyrically, \"On My Mind\" talks about a one-night stand with someone the protagonist shouldn't be with, having a dichotomy between heart and head.

The first single released from the album was \"Under the Sheets\", which Goulding wrote in collaboration with Starsmith.  Starsmith co-wrote four other songs and served as the album's primary producer.  Goulding also collaborated with Jonny Lattimer on the singles \"Starry Eyed\" and \"The Writer\", and shared writing credits with Fraser T Smith on \"Your Biggest Mistake\".  In November 2010, the singer re-released \"Lights\" as \"Bright Lights\", which included the standard version of the album and several new songs.  She collaborated with Richard Stannard and Ash Howes on \"Lights\" and recorded a cover version of Elton John's \"Your Song\".

Goulding also collaborated with Jonny Lattimer on the singles \"Starry Eyed\" and \"The Writer\", and shared writing credits with Fraser T Smith on \"Your Biggest Mistake\".  In November 2010, the singer re-released \"Lights\" as \"Bright Lights\", which included the standard version of the album and several new songs.  She collaborated with Richard Stannard and Ash Howes on \"Lights\" and recorded a cover version of Elton John's \"Your Song\".

Lyrically, \"On My Mind\" talks about a one-night stand with someone the protagonist shouldn't be with, having a dichotomy between heart and head.
