          "observation": "The 2011 Colorado Buffaloes football team represented the University of Colorado at Boulder in the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season.  Led by first-year head coach and alumnus Jon Embree, the Buffaloes played their home games on-campus at Folsom Field in Boulder and were first-year members of the newly expanded Pac-12 Conference.  They finished with a record of 3–10, 2–7 in Pac-12 play, in a tie for last place in the South Division.",
          "raw_response": "Thought: To identify the correct conference and year, I should look for documents related to the football team, as the question pertains to a record of 2-6 in conference play. The relevant transition for the Colorado Buffaloes football team was when they moved from the Big 12 to the Pac-12 Conference. I'll retrieve information from a document that might detail the year they joined the Pac-12, as this could help identify their 14th season in the conference.\n\nAction: Retrieve\nAction Input: {\"title\": \"2011 Colorado Buffaloes football team\"}"
